# My Bootstrap Portfolio Page

## The Assignment
This was my second homework assignment for UW Bootcamp. The assignment was to re-make our first portfolio assignment using Boostrap. 

## The Process
I found this assignment much easier than the first. Which makes sense, since Bootstrap makes adding CSS to your page much faster and easier because it comes with it's own responsive grid layout and break points. Similar to the first project, I made the navbar and footer first and added them to each page. Next I added the unique body content for each page. I copied and pasted in Bootstrap code and then customized it by removing or adding elements and attributes. Last I added some of my own CSS using an external stylesheet.

## The Outcome
My profile turned out polished and responsive, fitting the requirements of the assignment. 

## Next Steps
While using Bootstrap was a quick way to style my page, it doesn't look unique or have much personality. My portfolio could use:
1. Unique styles such as different colors, layout and design that show off my CSS skills and add some personality
2. An new about me section that is not just placeholder text

Eventually, I hope to learn more JavaScript that I can use to add some responsive behavior to my site and a server side language such as PHP or Ruby so I can collect data from my contact form.
